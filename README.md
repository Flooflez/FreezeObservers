# No TNT Griefing

This simple fabric mod for Minecraft that implements a new gamerule that prevents observers from sending a redstone signal. This is super helpful when building with observers to stop them from triggering pistons, droppers and other redstone components before they're ready. 

### How it works
Use the following command
```
/gamerule freezeObservers true
```
to stop observers from emitting a redstone signal.
